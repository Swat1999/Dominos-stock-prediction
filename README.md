# Dominos-stock-prediction
This repo contains two Jupyter Notebook having two methods of predicting the stock price of dominos. Feel free to check which method provides best result. Both method has Tensorflow and keras modules.

1. Both files has the usage of Deep learning methods of tensorflow and keras.
2. The first file uses RMSE model with model checkpoints where the RMSE was split into training and testing data.
3. The second file uses a long model of LSTM, Dense and Compiles which we did not use in the first case.


If you think you can make it much better and predict the outcome of the model in a more efficient way while also calculating the accuracy score then please feel free try it out and share it with me so that i can improve it as well. It will greatly help me in my journey of data science.

Thank you.
